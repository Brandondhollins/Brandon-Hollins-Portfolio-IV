        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Greetings. I'm Brandon. I was born in Jackson, MS and studied computer science at the University of Mississippi. In the midst of the pandemic, I taught myself product design by developing an app, which led me to discover the world of design. I have worked at M1 Finance and SimplePractice as Product Design Intern. I am an Associate Product Designer at SimplePractice, working on the design systems team.
             <br>This year I am focusing on improving my visual design, systems thinking, and craftsmanship.
